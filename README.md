## TRaSHell

While working on [dash](https://github.com/leeian1011/dsh) I learnt a lot about how the shell works and also about
child processes and why certain programs can be made externally and why some are built-in, most of them tend to be performance issues
but others are process logic issues like 'cd'!

I've decided to make a mini simple shell that imitates the behaviour of typical shells like bash from scratch with C to further my understanding!
